<h3 align="center">PRODUCTION RATE OF AGRICULTURE PRODUCTS</h3>



## About The Project
Our Project aims to validate and calculate the agriculture crop yield and productions based on the previous year data.By using the Machine learning technique such as “Arima Algorithm”, 
we can achieve the solution for the above mentioned statement.
We forecast the data with 90% accuracy based on the dataset collected from the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Government Of India.
By predicting the upcoming rate,we can know the production rate and its corresponding profit rate or else loss rate.

## Project Overview

Agriculture is an important sector of Indian economy as it contributes about 17% to the total GDP and provides employment to over 60% of the population. Therefore it is essential to calculate the production rate and to maintain the GDP rate. Indian agriculture has registered impressive growth over last few decades. This project aims to predict the production rate of agriculture products for the upcoming year based on the previous year data. Scope of this project is to know about the rate of yield and growth rate.The existing model investigates the causality between agricultural crops and yield. But our project aims to predict the upcoming rate of productions by year. In this project, it is proposed to use “ARIMA ALGORITHM” machine learning technique to provide solution. The dataset used in this project has been collected from the “MINISTRY OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY, GOVERNMENT OF INDIA”. This data include commodity wise export rate over the past 20 years.
